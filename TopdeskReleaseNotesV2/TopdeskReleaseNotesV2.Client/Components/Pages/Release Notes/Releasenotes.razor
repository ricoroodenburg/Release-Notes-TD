                        <strong>Search functionality in list view:</strong><br>
                        A search bar has been added to the list view, allowing users to quickly find specific release notes by version number or description. This makes it easier to locate relevant updates without scrolling through the full list.

                        <strong>Persisted theme (dark/light mode) selection across sessions:</strong><br>
                        The selected theme is now saved in a cookie (ReleaseNotesTdTheme). This ensures that the chosen light or dark mode is remembered, even after closing the browser or navigating away. When the user returns to the application, the previously selected theme will automatically be restored for a seamless experience.

                        All pages in the application are now rendered entirely on the client side. This improves performance and provides a smoother user experience by reducing server load and allowing for faster interactions within the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bug Fix: Content Loaded Twice on Page Load:</strong><br>
